    "VeryHigh": "The assessed system presents a **very high** risk level with a score of {score}. Operating in a {environment} environment with {exposure} exposure, this {systemType} system classified at {classification} faces critical threats. Current control effectiveness is rated at level {controlEffectiveness} with a likelihood rating of {likelihood}. **Immediate action is required** to implement enhanced security controls in the {domain} domain. The combination of high exposure and weak controls creates an unacceptable risk posture that demands priority remediation.",
    "High": "The assessment reveals a **high** risk level with a score of {score}. The {environment} environment with {exposure} exposure significantly contributes to the risk profile of this {systemType} system. At classification level {classification}, with control effectiveness at level {controlEffectiveness} and likelihood at {likelihood}, **prompt attention is needed** to strengthen defenses in the {domain} domain. Enhanced monitoring and accelerated control implementation are recommended.",
    "Medium": "The system shows a **medium** risk level with a score of {score}. Operating in a {environment} environment with {exposure} exposure, this {systemType} system at classification {classification} has a moderate risk profile. Control effectiveness at level {controlEffectiveness} and likelihood at {likelihood} suggest a **balanced but improvable** security posture in the {domain} domain. Planned improvements should be prioritized in the next review cycle.",
    "Low": "The assessment indicates a **low** risk level with a score of {score}. The {environment} environment with {exposure} exposure provides a favorable risk profile for this {systemType} system at classification {classification}. With control effectiveness at level {controlEffectiveness} and likelihood at {likelihood}, the {domain} domain demonstrates **adequate protection**. Continue regular monitoring and maintain current controls.",
    "VeryLow": "The system demonstrates a **very low** risk level with a score of {score}. Operating in a {environment} environment with {exposure} exposure, this {systemType} system at classification {classification} benefits from strong controls. With effectiveness at level {controlEffectiveness} and low likelihood at {likelihood}, the {domain} domain is **well-protected**. Maintain current security posture and conduct periodic reviews."
